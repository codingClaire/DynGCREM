# Part 3 Experiment
This part contains the source codes of every experiment in my final article except the first experiment which makes a comparison of the DynGCREM model and other dynamic graph node embedding methods. The implementation of the comparison methods is in  [CTGCN](https://github.com/jhljx/CTGCN) repository in Github. I change the input form and set the hyper-parameters to train the models and complete the comparison experiment.
The implementation of the following experiments is in this part, however, it is repetitive and the brief implementation can be found in part 2.
